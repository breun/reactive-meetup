# Reactive Meetup Craftsmen & NS

## Introduction

This workshop is meant to get familiar with RxJS or RxJava (which are part of the ReactiveX family). The focus lies on the use of Reactive operators. A small case is used, providing information about train arrival and departure times and passenger check in and outs. 

## Installation and usage

The repository contains two directories: a `JS` directory and a `Java` directory. Instructions for installation and usage can be found there.
