This workshop is meant to get familiar with RxJS or RxJava (which are part of the ReactiveX family). The focus lies on the use of Reactive operators. A small case is used, providing information about train arrival and departure times and passenger check in and outs. 

## Installation and usage

The repository contains two directories: a `javascript` directory and a `java` directory. Both directories contain a readme with instruction on installation of the work enviroment en 
usage of the exercises and references to external documentation.
