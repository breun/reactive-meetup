# Reactive Programming workshop 16-12-2016

Welcome to the Reactive Programming workshop!

This workshop is meant to get familiar with RxJS or RxJava (which are part of the ReactiveX family).
The focus of this workshop lies on familiarizing yourself with the ReactiveX API.
In the presentation prior to the workshop we will explain the Reactive Programming fundamentals and introduce ReactiveX.
On the 16th of december we will also publish the slides of the presentation here, so you can use them as reference material for the workshop exercises.
