# Reactive Programming Workshop for Java

## Setup

* First make sure you've got Java 8 installed on your machine.
If not you can download the latest version from: [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

* [Download](https://gitlab.com/craftsmen/reactive-meetup/repository/archive.zip?ref=master) or [clone](https://gitlab.com/craftsmen/reactive-meetup.git) the workshop files from [https://gitlab.com/craftsmen/reactive-meetup](https://gitlab.com/craftsmen/reactive-meetup)

* Once you have downloaded or cloned the workshop files open the `java` directory with your favorite IDE.

## Exercises

You can find the exercises in the `nl.craftsmen.workshops.reactivemeetup.exercises` package.
There are two subpackages `one` and `two` for both parts of the workshop.
Within each of these packages you will find classes labelled `ExerciseXX` which contain executable `main()` methods.
Every exercise class contains the necessary information and assignment to solve the exercise.
None of the exercises depend on other exercises, so if necessary you can skip exercises (although we do not recommend that).

## Reference resources

An online version of the presentation can be viewed [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404) which you can use as reference material for workshop exercises.
Furthermore visit the ReactiveX documentation page for more detailed information about RxJava:

* [Overview of the ReactiveX operators](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators.html)
* [API documentation](http://reactivex.io/RxJava/javadoc/)

_Please note that for the workshop we are using RxJava 1.2.1._
_Shortly after the development of this workshop started, RxJava 2 was released._
_We haven't had to time to upgrade the workshop to RxJava 2 yet._
_So be careful if you search online for RxJava documentation, you might end up with the documentation for RxJava 2._
_Although the API hasn't changed that much, there are some breaking changes in RxJava 2._
_Hence always check if you were are looking at the right documentation if things don't appear to be working according to the docs ;)_

## Solutions

The solutions for the exercises are available as well.
These can be found in the `solutions` branch of this GIT repository.
Obviously try not to peek at the solutions before you have tried to solve the assignments yourself.
If you get stuck during the workshop, we will be there to help you :)
