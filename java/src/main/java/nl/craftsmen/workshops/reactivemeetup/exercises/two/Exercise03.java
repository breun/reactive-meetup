		// check in and check out with their "OV chipkaart". Many railway stations have adopted gates which (in the future) can
		// only be opened by either checking in or checking out. The gateCheckEvent$ stream below represents the checkins and 
		// checkouts for such a gate at a railway station.

		// ASSIGNMENT: Define the gateIsFree$ stream based on the provided gateCheckEvent$. This stream should emit boolean
		// values, where true indicates that the gate is free and false indicates that is occupied (being used by someone).
		//
		// Note that the stream should emit alternating values, i.e. two successive values may not be the same. For example,
		// "true, true, false" is not a valid output, while "true, false, true" is okay.
		//
		// A gate is considered to be free if in the last 1,5 seconds nobody has checked in or out. Initially the gate is
		// considered to be free, so your output should always start with "true".
		//
		// HINT: To specify the 1,5 second interval use the GATE_OCCUPY_TIME constant in combination with TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.
		//
		// HINT: Solve this assignment using divide and conquer. First try to define two streams, one that tells whenever the
		// gate is occupied and another that tells when the gate is free. Next find a way to combine those streams to get the
		// desired output.
